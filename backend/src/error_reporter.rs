//! Error reporting — the only place in the codebase that calls Sentry directly.

//! been initialised (i.e. `SENTRY_DSN` is unset in development).

/// Captures an unexpected error and forwards it to the error monitoring service.
///
/// Only call this for truly unexpected failures (5xx territory). Expected
/// domain errors — not found, validation, conflict — are client mistakes and
/// must not be reported here.
